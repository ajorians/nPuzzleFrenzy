Puzzle Frenzy for the TI-NSpire calculator

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  It was based off of the TI-83+ game called Puzzle Frenzy.  It works on the TI-NSpire CX CAS with ndless 3.1 and should work on the TI-nspire models.  It is a puzzle game.  The goal is to clear the board.  You do this by moving the selector and then swapping either 2 pieces or pulling a piece out.  Any and all pieces will fall if they can; and anytime there is 3 or more in a row or column of the same piece then those pieces will disappear.  You only have a certain number of moves.  I hope you enjoy it!

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-drop the nPuzzleFrenzy-sdl.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 on your calculator in order to run it!

After you run it; you can add and play additional levels.  With ndless it allows start up files; and so you can add more level files to your calculator and play them!

How to play:
Navigate the menu using the arrow keys (or 2 and 8 keys) and the Enter key to start a new game.
Use the arrow keys (or 2,4,6 and 8 keys) to move the selector around the board
Use the Enter (or Ctrl) key to swap 2 pieces (or pull out a piece if swapping with nothing).
Use the - and + keys to undo and redo your moves.

Extra levels:
This program works with external level files!  There is only a sample level that is very easy.  See the source code file PuzzleLevels.h to see the make-up of the puzzle files should you want to make your own.  Extra level files which can be placed in any folder on the calculator.  A subfolder is a great place to put them.  When you first ran nPuzzleFrenzy-sdl it registered the extension 'puzfrenz' and so because the levels have the extension 'puzfrenz' at the end it is associated with the nPuzzleFrenzy-sdl program.  Let me know if you'd be interested in a level editor or additional levels!  The make-up of a level is very simple; you'll probably be able to figure it out.

Source:
I included my source.  I programmed with C++ which you can find out more here: http://blog.tangrs.id.au/?p=712  It uses nSDL as well as the ndless Software Development Kit.
